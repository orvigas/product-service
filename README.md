# Spring Boot 3.4.* product-service
This tutorial is about a Spring Boot 3.4.* based microservice. This time, we are going to create a simple "CRUD" microservice that will allow us to manage a database "product" table upon a Rest Controller that will contain Create, Read, Update, and Delete endpoints. We will also add a List operation with pagination, sorting, and filtering features.
## Concept definitions
Before starting, we need to define a few concepts to have a clear background about the things that we will work on within this project.
### Microservices
A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous, and loosely coupled services. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability, operates independently, and communicates with other services through lightweight protocols such as HTTP or messaging queues. This approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and agility in software development.
### C.R.U.D.
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations performed on data in a database or persistent storage.

- Create: Adding new data (e.g., inserting a new record).
- Read: Retrieving or querying existing data.
- Update: Modifying existing data.
- Delete: Removing data.

These operations form the foundation of most software systems that handle data management.
### Rest Controller
A REST Controller is a component in a web application that handles HTTP requests and provides responses in a RESTful web service. In frameworks like Spring Boot, it is typically defined using the @RestController annotation.

It simplifies development by combining the functionality of @Controller and @ResponseBody, allowing methods to return data directly as JSON or XML without the need for view templates. REST Controllers are commonly used to expose APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
### Services
@Service is an annotation in Spring Framework used to mark a class as a service layer component. It indicates that the class contains business logic and acts as an intermediary between the controller and repository layers in a Spring application.

By using @Service, the class is automatically detected and registered as a Spring bean, enabling dependency injection and making it easier to manage and test the application's business logic.
### Repositories
@Repository is an annotation in the Spring Framework used to indicate that a class is responsible for interacting with the database. It marks the class as a data access layer component.

Key features of @Repository:
- It enables automatic detection and registration as a Spring bean.
- It translates database-related exceptions into Spring's unified exception hierarchy, making exception handling consistent and manageable.

Classes annotated with @Repository typically include methods for CRUD operations and custom queries.

## Building an Application with Spring Boot
If you want to create your own Spring Boot-based project, visit <a href="https://start.spring.io" target="_blank">Spring Initializr</a>, fill in your project details, pick your options, and download a bundled up project as a zip file.
### Product Service Project Conf
Open the Spring Initializr and configure a new project as follows

Download and unzip the project in your computer

Load your project into your preferred IDE (I'm using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/download/other.html">IntelliJ Idea CE</a>),
download and unzip the project in your computer.

## Project configuration
From now on we will begin to configure the starters (plug-ins) that we added when creating our project. I want to emphasize that we will not go into specific details of each plugin, but rather we will try to focus on its specific configuration for this project; I recommend that if you want to know more about all the plugins and their configurations, do a search on sites like baeldung.com, which compiles high-quality related material that can be very useful.
### H2 Database
H2 is a lightweight, open-source, in-memory relational database written in Java. It is commonly used for development, testing, and small-scale applications due to its simplicity and fast performance.
Key features of H2 include:
- Embedded and server modes: Can run as an in-memory database or as a standalone server.
- SQL support: Fully compatible with the SQL standard.
- Ease of use: Requires minimal configuration.

H2 is popular in Spring Boot applications for testing because it integrates seamlessly and resets with each application restart.

#### Datasource configuration
In your project open `/product-service/src/main/resources/application.properties` and add the following:
```properties
spring.application.name=product-service

#Spring datasource
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:products
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=password

#JPA
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true

#H2 DB
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-ui
```
Run your application and open a web browser, let's test the H2 console by going to `http://localhost:8080/h2-ui`, once the console login form is loaded, use your credentials defined in the `#Spring datasource` section of your `application.properties` file and test if you have access.
<figure>
    <img src="/readme-assets/h2.png"
         alt="H2 Console">
    <figcaption>After clicking the "Test Connection" button you should see a green "Test successful" message.</figcaption>
</figure>

Click connect, and you should be redirected to the H2 DB console like this.

         alt="H2 Console">
    <figcaption>In this page you will be able to run SQL queries verify your table structure, etc.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Database Initialization
After configuring the H2 Database in our project, we should be able to load data into the database by following the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/data-initialization.html">documentation</a>, which says that we are able to load data into our DB on project start by setting spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto to control Hibernateâ€™s database initialization. Supported values are none, validate, update, create, and create-drop.

In addition, a file named data.sql in the root of the classpath (`src/main/resources/data.sql`) is executed on startup if Hibernate creates the schema from scratch (that is, if the ddl-auto property is set to create or create-drop).

```sql
DROP TABLE if EXISTS products CASCADE;
DROP sequence if EXISTS products_seq;
CREATE sequence products_seq start WITH 1 increment by 50;
CREATE TABLE products (price float(53), tax_rate float(53), id bigint NOT NULL, description varchar(255), name varchar(255), sku varchar(255) UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY (id));

INSERT INTO products (id,sku,name,description,price,tax_rate)
VALUES
  (1,5223,'#ea9c9a','purus mauris a nunc. In at pede. Cras vulputate velit',34,3),
  (2,8192,'#70eace','NULLam feugiat placerat velit. Quisque varius. Nam porttitor',39,2),
  (3,5050,'#f7f25b','Fusce aliquet magna a neque. NULLam ut',103,6);
```

Run the application again, connect to the H2 DB console, you should see a new table called `products`, click on it and run the query
